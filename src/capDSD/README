About
----------------------------
capDSD is an extension of DSD (available at dsd.cs.tufts.edu) that takes in to account
a measure of interaction confidence while also incorporating directed pathway data.

Installation
----------------------------
capDSD requires Python 2.7 and an installation of numpy.  To run, simply place the .py files in the desired directory and invoke using the python interpreter.

----------------------------
Using DSD.py
----------------------------
Run python DSD.py -h for information on arguments.  capDSD takes a PPI and optionally a directory of PPIPs (PPI pathways).  

The format for PPIs is tab delimited:
Protein1    Protein2    confidence
ProteinX    ProteinY    confidence
...

Confidence is optional, but must be specified in a flag passed to DSD.py if it is to be used. If the PPI is treated as directed, the direction is from the first column to the second.

The format for PPIPs is tab delimited:
Protein1    Protein2    type1   type2
ProteinX    ProteinY    typeX   typeY   typeZ
...

Types are optional, and are used with -m 3 (default) to determine whether or not to treat the edge as directed.  If all of the types are present in a list of "directed types," 
the edge is treated as directed.

To run cDSD, simply pass a properly formatted PPI as infile and specify the -c flag.
To run caDSD, use the -c flag, specify the directory with the ppip files with -p, and use -mult 0
To run capDSD, use the -c flag, specify the directory with the ppip files with -p

Parameters m, s, and r can be specified with -mult, -s, and -r respectively, but will default to the values of 25, 7, and .7 that are used in the paper. 

A small example is available at bcb.cs.tufts.edu/capdsd/files/testdata.zip

Using KeggParse.py
----------------------------
KeggParse.py is used to parse a directory of .kgml files from http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ and output them in .ppip format.  Run with KeggParse.py /target/directory/path/

----------------------------
Generating confidence scores
----------------------------
The source code for generating confidence scores for a given PPI is not available at the moment, but may be at a future date.
